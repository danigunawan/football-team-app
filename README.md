# football-team-app
This is an app with two clients, one built with react, the other built with react-native which both talk to a backend using a laravel API. This app allows people to create players and generate two balanced football teams according to their skill levels.

To see the hosted version of the react app please visit here: http://18.130.166.177/

If you want to install the app, see the mobile version or host the entire thing locally, follow the instructions below.
